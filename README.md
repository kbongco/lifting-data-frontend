## Fourth Meet Prep Data Display and Analysis 

### Overview 

This is a project I created displaying the singles that I took leading up to my powerlifting meet December 2022. Its a mini "data analysis" project as well as a full stack project. 

I did this as a new portfolio project as a way to show off my skills and what I enjoy and love to do outside of being a developer. A lot of my projects have been front end related, and it has been a while since I have done a full stack project and I came up with this idea one day while trying to figure out what to do with some old training videos. 

### Technologies used 
1. Front End: React JS, SCSS, Chart.js 
2. Back End: Ruby, Ruby on Rails
   1. To see the backend code, it is on this repository: https://github.com/kbongco/Chibi4thMeetProgress
3. Backend Deployment: TBD 
4. Frontend deployment: TBD
5. Link to view page: Not yet deployed!

### MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
- As someone viewing this page, I should be able to see graphs detailing the progress on the squat, bench, deadlift
- As someone viewing this app, I should be able to see a summary detailing the lifts 
- As someone viewing this app, I should find a "under construction page" to indicate that the page is underconstruction if the link is not ready 

### Future Enhancements 
- A reusable table component 
- Convert from Chart.js to D3.js
- Clean up Squat, Bench, Deadlift graphs to be more reusable instead of duplicated
